## Functionalities

- Create your trip on the initial page
- Add activities to your trip
- Add important links such as hotel reservations
- Add participants to your trip! The more, the merrier!

## Improvements maded by me

# These functionalities make the the users free to manipule the information
You can delete both links and participants that you don't want anymore in your trip.
You can now change the destination or the date of your trip!

# This help the users to know if they already did a activity
Activities that have already happened will be marked in green.

## Running Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-the-project
```

Navigate to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install the dependecies

```bash
  npm install
```

start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Repeat these steps for both frontend and backend files.

## Learnings

I REALLY learned a lot, especially about Node.js. This is basically my first project in the NLW using Node.js and it was very challenging. I'm not used to working with backend, so everything was new. I had stopped studying programming, so the frontend part was vital to retake my studies.

## About me ðŸ™‚
I'm 17 years old, studying programming for fun. I want to be a full-stack developer.
